   (description "ClinVar is a freely accessible, public archive of reports
of the relationships among human variations and phenotypes, with supporting
evidence.  ClinVar thus facilitates access to and communication about the
relationships asserted between human variation and observed health status,
and the history of that interpretation.  ClinVar processes submissions
reporting variants found in patient samples, assertions made regarding their
clinical significance, information about the submitter, and other supporting
data.  The alleles described in submissions are mapped to reference sequences,
and reported according to the HGVS standard.  ClinVar then presents the data
for interactive users as well as those wishing to use ClinVar in daily
workflows and other local applications.  ClinVar works in collaboration with
interested organizations to meet the needs of the medical genetics community
as efficiently and effectively as possible.")
